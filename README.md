# Space Engineers Scripts

This repository stores in-game programmable block scripts for Space Engineers.

## How This Repo Is Used
- GitHub is storage and version history only
- Scripts are manually copy-pasted into Programmable Blocks
- Space Engineers is the compiler and test environment

## Rules
- One script per file
- Never overwrite a working script
- Version number increases on logic changes
- Script headers are mandatory and standardized
- Scripts are tested in-game before being marked stable

## Folder Purpose
- /inventory  → cargo and connector logic
- /drones     → autonomous grid behavior
- /utilities  → templates and shared helpers
