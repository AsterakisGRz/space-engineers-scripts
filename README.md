# Space Engineers Scripts

Personal library of in-game programmable block scripts for Space Engineers.

## Rules
- One script per file
- GitHub is the single source of truth
- Scripts are copy-pasted into Programmable Blocks
- Never overwrite a working script
- Version number increases on logic changes
- Status must reflect real testing state

## Folder Structure
- /inventory  → cargo, connectors, sorting
- /drones     → autonomous grids, remote control
- /utilities  → shared helpers, templates, constants

## Script Status Definitions
- Untested: Compiles only
- Tested: Runs in-game without errors
- Stable: Handles missing blocks and edge cases safely
