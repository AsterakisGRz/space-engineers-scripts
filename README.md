# Space Engineers Scripts

A structured library of programmable block scripts for Space Engineers.

## Structure
- `inventory/` — cargo, refineries, connectors
- `drones/` — autonomous mining and return logic
- `utilities/` — shared helpers (LCDs, parsing, math)

## Rules
- One script per file
- Every script must declare version and purpose
- No breaking changes without version bump
